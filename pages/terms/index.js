              The arbitration will be conducted before a neutral single

              arbitral proceedings will be governed by JAMS under its
              Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”)
              as modified by these Terms and Conditions. The JAMS Rules are

              . All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope
              of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by the
              terms of these Terms and Conditions. If you initiate arbitration,
              your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth
              in the JAMS Rules. We will reimburse all other JAMS filing,
              administration and arbitrator fees paid by you, unless the
              arbitrator determines that the arbitration was frivolous or
              brought for an improper purpose, in which case the payment of all
              such fees shall be governed by the JAMS Rules. The arbitration
              will be conducted in the English language. Judgment on the award
              rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
              competent jurisdiction. For any claim where the potential award is
              reasonably likely to be $10,000 or less, either you or HelloTalk
              may elect to have the dispute resolved through
              non-appearance-based arbitration.
